# ¡¡ Notice !!

After an extented period of life getting in the way I'm back to [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) development. I'll be rebasing every project as I resume work on it. Projects that use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) will resume as version `5.0.0` for Bootstrap 5.x.

# Installation

The preferred way to install P2Y2 Base is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).
Depending on your composer installation, run *one* of the following commands:

```
	composer require p2made/p2y2-base "~4.0"
```

or

```
	php composer.phar require p2made/p2y2-base "~4.0"
```

Alternatively add:

```
	"p2made/p2y2-base": "~4.0"
```

to the requires section of your `composer.json` file & P2Y2 Base will be installed next time you run `composer update`.

Actually, you probably don't need to do any of that because you're probably not going to install `p2y2-base` on its own. If you install any of my bundles that require `p2y2-base`, they will install it as a dependancy.
