# P2Y2 Base v4.0.0

A base bundle for other [P2Y2](https://github.com/p2made) bundles.

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install P2Y2 Base is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).
Depending on your composer installation, run *one* of the following commands:

```
    composer require p2made/yii2-p2y2-base "~4.0"
```

or

```
    php composer.phar require p2made/yii2-p2y2-base "~4.0"
```

Alternatively add:

```
    "p2made/yii2-p2y2-base": "~4.0"
```

to the requires section of your `composer.json` file & P2Y2 Base will be installed next time you run `composer update`.

Actually, you probably don't need to do any of that because you're probably not going to install `yii2-p2y2-base` on its own. If you install any of my bundles that require `yii2-p2y2-base`, they will install it as a dependancy.
